# Building Logical Plans: The Mindset

  1. Start with "What do I need to KNOW before I can DO?"
    - Don't plan actions on things you don't understand yet
    - Research/learning phases come before execution phases
  2. Each phase should answer: "What OUTPUT does this produce that the next phase needs?"
    - If Phase 3 needs a checklist, Phase 2 must create it
    - If you can't define the output, the phase is too vague
  3. Work backwards from the goal:
    - Goal: Validate the example
    - To validate, I need: A checklist
    - To create checklist, I need: Requirements and standards
    - To know requirements, I need: To read the docs
    - Therefore: Read docs → Document requirements → Build checklist → Validate
  4. Block yourself from jumping ahead:
    - Add "NOTE: Can only start after Phase X" to enforce dependencies
    - If you can't start a phase without something, say so explicitly
  5. Make the plan self-documenting:
    - Each phase adds a section to the plan file
    - Later phases reference earlier sections
    - The plan file becomes the artifact of your research
  6. Ask "Why?" at each step:
    - Why this phase before that one?
    - Why do I need this information?
    - If you can't answer "why", you're probably rushing

  The key: Your ignorance should drive the plan structure, not be hidden by it.
